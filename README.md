# Locally hosted ChatGPT
This is a fork of [Sentdex](https://github.com/Sentdex/)'s [ChatGPT-at-Home](https://github.com/Sentdex/ChatGPT-at-Home) GitHub repository

The purpose of this repository is to include additional models and options for use in a locally accessable Large Language Model (LLM) chatbot application

You can uncomment lines in `app.py` to select the `model` for use, and a `generator function` to use

More details coming soon
